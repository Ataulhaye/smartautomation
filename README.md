## Project Overview
Title: Smartautomation
Start Date: November 16, 2024
End Date: February 28, 2025
Supervisor: Visvanathan Ramesh (vramesh@em.uni-frankfurt.de)

### Minimal viable product
The VS Code extension Smartautomation generates automatically comment suggestions for python code in a seperate view and the user can decide to accept them into his/her project or not. The user can select python files and press a button to have these files commented.

### Estimated Timeline
- 1 week: Initial Planning and Research
- 1 week: Architecture and Design
- 9 weeks: Core Development
- 3 weeks: Testing and Debugging
- 1 week: Evaluation

### Actual Workflow
- Initial Planning and Research: 2 weeks
- Testing different Development approaches: 2 weeks
- Core Development: 10 weeks
- Testing, Debugging, Evaluation: 1 week

## Requirements

### Features

- Enable users to add comments to the code using defined shortcuts or menu options. These shortcuts could be changed according to the user preferences.
- Implement syntax highlighting for comments.
- Allow categorization or tagging of comments, such as `ToDo`, `FixMe`, `DoNotChangeMe`, etc.

### Graphical User Interface

- **Dedicated Side Panel for Comments**: Feature a specialized side panel that facilitates easy access to automated comment generation functionalities, streamlining the development process.
- **Detailed Change Overview Panel**: Introduce an additional side panel specifically designed to display detailed information about changes, allowing users to easily review and understand modifications made to the code.

### **Configuration Support**

Enable users to customize their environment settings through a settings JSON file. This includes options such as defining keyboard shortcuts and specifying the AI model endpoint, providing flexibility to adapt the extension to individual preferences.

### Non-functional requirements

**Performance:**

Ensure the extension is lightweight and does not significantly impact VS Code's performance or responsiveness.

**Compatibility:**
Support for multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This given by default, since VS Code is compatible with every os.

**Scalability:**

Initially focused on supporting Python, this project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion to accommodate additional programming languages.

## Extension Settings
